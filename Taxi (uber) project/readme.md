# ðŸš• Taxi (uber) Data Engineering End to End Project

## Objective
In this project, I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline that consists different processes:

- extracted data from New York City trip record data website and loaded into AWS S3 storage for further processing.
- transformed and modeled the dataset using fact and dim data modelling tactics using python in jupyter notebook.
- created an AWS bucket, allowed public access and also set up an EC2 instance for our project.
- adopting ETL process, i orchestrated the data pipeline in MAGE AI and loaded the transformed data into AWS Redshift.
- developed a dashboard in Power BI.
